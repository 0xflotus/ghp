# Go Hypertext Preprocessor

Serve stuff over the interwebs with Go in a PHP-like fashion.

- Simply create and edit .go files in a straight-forward directory structure
- A directory with a `index.go` file is considered a GHP endpoint. `func ServeHTTP(r ghp.Request, w ghp.Response)` will be called to handle HTTP requests.
- Hot-reloading at runtime without the need to restart a server
- Source graph optionally computed live for perfect dependency knowledge â€” change a source file in a far-away dependency and have appropriate GHP endpoints be recompiled and reloaded.

Example:

`hello/index.go`

```go
func ServeHTTP(r ghp.Request, w ghp.Response) {
  w.WriteString("Hello world")
}
```

## Usage

```
./init.sh  # just needed first time
./build.sh
./build/ghp
```

Open `http://localhost:8002/example/`

Edit go files in `pub/example` and reload your web browser.


### Dev setup:

- Terminal 1: `autorun -r=500 ghp/*.go -- ./build.sh`
- Terminal 2: `autorun build/ghp -- ./build/ghp`

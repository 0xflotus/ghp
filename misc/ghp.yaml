# zdr enables Zero-Downtime Restarts by allowing two GHP processes to
# coordinate shutdown and startup.
#
# When enabled, starting a GHP process that belongs to the same zdr group
# as an already-running GHP process, will communicate with the existing
# process to coordinate shudown of the existing process, and startup of
# the new process.
#
# The following steps occur during such a restart:
# 
# 1. Existing process P1 listens on a shared resource like a unix socket,
#    unique to the zdr group.
# 2. A new process P2 is started and sends a message to P1 saying it's
#    ready to take over.
# 3. P1 stops accepting new requests and hands over "listen & accept"
#    responsibility to P2, and begins graceful shutdown
# 4. P2 starts listening for and accepting new connections & requests.
# 5. P1 eventually exits when all ongoing requests are served to completion.
#
# By default the zdr group of a GHP process is automatically decided based
# on pub-dir (or cache-dir, when customized.)
# You can explicitly define the group by setting the "group" property.
